Course API Endpoint README

This README provides an overview of the Course API Endpoint, a Java-based application built with Spring Boot. The API offers endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on course resources.

Introduction

The Course API Endpoint is designed to facilitate the management of courses. It provides a set of RESTful endpoints to perform CRUD operations, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete course resources.
Setup

To set up the Course API Endpoint on your local machine, follow these steps:

    Ensure you have Java JDK and Maven installed.

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/course-api-endpoint.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd course-api-endpoint

Build the project using Maven:

mvn clean install

Run the application:

bash

    java -jar target/course-api-endpoint.jar

    The API will now be running locally on http://localhost:8080.

Usage

Once the API is up and running, you can make HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations on course resources. You can use tools like cURL, Postman, or any programming language's HTTP client to interact with the API.
Endpoints

The Course API Endpoint provides the following endpoints:

    GET /courses: Retrieves all courses.
    GET /courses/{id}: Retrieves a specific course by its ID.
    POST /courses: Creates a new course.
    PUT /courses/{id}: Updates an existing course.
    DELETE /courses/{id}: Deletes a course by its ID.
